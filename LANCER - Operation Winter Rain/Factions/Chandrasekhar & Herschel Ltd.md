# Description
C&H focuses on what they refer to as “unorthodox combat solutions,” providing
specialized designs that larger corporations have eschewed or are slow in pivoting
towards. Their frames and licenses are frequently adapted from gladiatorial and sporting
designs, and many of their weapons and systems were originally improvised and adapted,
or as some contest pirated, from other sources. As a result of this, their mechs are as
diverse as their origins, without the common thread that ties other corporations' licenses
together.
