# Description
Alone in the void of space, Iridia was a peaceful jewel. Beneath the gaze of their goddess, Hestia, they prospered, with nobody wanting for anything. But, it was not to last. From the stars descended demons, and with that… life forever changed on the planet. Something terrible was about to awake.
The Iridian civilization at first crumpled beneath the assault, having not known violence. But eventually, with the aid of their goddess, they were able to replicate the armours that the invaders wore. And eventually… beyond. From Hestia’s forges, technology never before seen sprang to life, powered by demonic energies. The wrath of the planet, shaped into mechanical form, drove the invaders to a near-standstill, with hopes of soon returning back to the way that things once were.
But once something has been discovered, it turns out, it’s very hard to put it back in the box…
