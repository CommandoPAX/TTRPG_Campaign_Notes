# Description
Chandrasekhar & Herschel is one of the youngest Galactic-Tier corporations to offer specialty mech licenses to qualified pilots. The company was founded by Jun Chandrasekhar, a gladiator pilot and revolutionary leader, along with former racing pilot
Mattias Herschel. The initial license of incorporation was granted to Chandrasekhar as a
boon for her performance in the arena by self-appointed Emir Julian Ambrose Khan during
his tyrannical rule over the world of Suldan. Chandrasekhar made use of the printer permissions granted to her as part of incorporation to manufacture mechs and weaponry,
covertly equipping the beleaguered rebellion effort against the Emir. Mattias Herschel, a
member of Suldan's upper class who had been a prestigious chassis racer before his
retirement, was sympathetic towards the rebels and lent both his engineering expertise
and his air of legitimacy to Chandrasekhar's fledgling endeavor.

In the aftermath of the Emir's most recent death, both Chandrasekhar and Herschel discovered that their joint venture had attracted a growing and dedicated base of pilots actively seeking out their licenses for use elsewhere. With infusions of capital and designs
from investors who prefer to remain anonymous, C&H Ltd. continued to expand their
offerings, and while they have a ways to go before they rise to the ranks of corporations
such as IPS-N Northstar or Smith-Shimano, forward-looking projections remain optimistic
as advertising and positive word of mouth continues to spread.

C&H focuses on what they refer to as “unorthodox combat solutions,” providing
specialized designs that larger corporations have eschewed or are slow in pivoting
towards. Their frames and licenses are frequently adapted from gladiatorial and sporting
designs, and many of their weapons and systems were originally improvised and adapted,
or as some contest pirated, from other sources. As a result of this, their mechs are as
diverse as their origins, without the common thread that ties other corporations' licenses
together.
