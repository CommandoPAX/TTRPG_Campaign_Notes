# Downfall Group
The danger inherent in telling someone something is that they will believe you. The  shadowy rogue subsidiary of IPS-N “known” as DOWNFALL has a rather plain beginning on paper, which paints an official role in predictive investment, pre-emptive military intervention, corporate espionage, and economic sabotage. However, the spiritual beginning of DOWNFALL is a simple statement: “We endorse and support the mission of Albatross.”

The danger inherent in believing something is that you will act on that belief.

The deep gulf that now exists between the internal culture of DOWNFALL Group and its parent company began with trends in the data. Competitor opportunities cut short by the successful establishment of human rights in a given system, Albatross interventions uncovering unethical experimentation on human life, colonies collapsed by reckless shortcuts meant to make them productive faster than they could be stable. While IPS-N touted support of humanitarian missions with one hand, the other was stained with the same blood and gold as the rest of its peers. Disillusionment gave rise to action and the oh-so-very unofficial shift of DOWNFALL Group’s mission from support of its parent company to wide-reaching action against human rights violations and, more broadly, the willful perpetuation of a chaotic galaxy for the benefit of the powerful.

Current thinking in DOWNFALL’s leadership places corpro-states as the largest enemies of human peace and prosperity, and prioritizes their destruction and Union’s preservation, in that order, to fulfill its humanitarian mandate. The reality is rarely as clean as swift insertions
to dispense justice; DOWNFALL is reliant on the resources and privileged intelligence it leeches from IPS-N to operate, and trades heavily on the secrecy of its mission in order to stay safe. Strikes have to be directed for maximum effect with as few risks and resources as
possible, and though DOWNFALL rejects the corporate culture of profit over people, it was still born of that culture. In the heat of the moment, DOWNFALL has sometimes chosen to put its cause above the real people they are ostensibly trying to help in order to set up for
future efforts, sorely testing the loyalty of its pilots. 

DOWNFALL’s “Sinner” pattern-groups, fielded almost solely by their own agents or rebellions they back, are culled from aborted research in IPS-N’s own archives added to a pool of specifications and schematics stolen via their espionage efforts, and inspired by the success of HORUS p-g operations. Most take pains to resemble a more standardized chassis, generally from IPS-N, with the few slip-ups of operational security to date chalked up to ‘prototypes’. Still, it’s only a matter of time before DOWNFALL is formally discovered, and will have to take action to preserve its own existence. To this end, select mercenary groups - notably and especially including Albatross - have been given limited licensing in order to prepare the way for DOWNFALL’s emergence into the public sphere. Quietly, patiently, they gather networks of contacts, contractors, and resources ever so slightly
separate from what they report and turn over to IPS-N, forming a new cloak for its mission: preserve Union, and bring glory to mankind.
