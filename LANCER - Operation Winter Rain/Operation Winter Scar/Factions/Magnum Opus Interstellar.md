# Description
Magnum Opus Interstellar is one of the longest- lasting design companies in the Union that has not been absorbed by one of the major corporations. The reason for this despite the company’s rather small size is because Magnum Opus Interstellar are a premier
developer of new components and designs for blink gates, keeping them stable and safe for many systems. This contract directly with the DoIT itself has allowed it to maintain independence and resist attempts to buy it out several times.

The heavy work they do with blink gates has also given them a closer (though by no means close) relationship with the Voladores than most members of Union. They often trade survey data from Voladore traders to more carefully tailor the plans for a planned blink gate to the system it will be inhabiting. As a result of this more common contact, Magnum Opus Interstellar often sells what they call ‘Voladore Inspired’ technology, though they are very insistent that they have never engaged in theft of it - and the continued trading with their primary facility, the New Agartha blink gate station, indicates that the Voladore believe they are honest.

Magnum Opus designs are primarily defensively based, skilled in evasion and trickery over direct conflict. While not pacifistic like the Voladore, Magnum Opus has made it clear that peace and exploration is much more profitable to them than war. Money spent on military campaigns is, after all, not being spent on new expeditions to create colonies that will require a blink gate. Despite this, their designs are popular among those with an interest in blinkspace technology. This is thanks to MOI’s tendency to use the Voladore-inspired technology in ways that allow their mechs to move in an unexpected, or even seemingly impossible fashion.
